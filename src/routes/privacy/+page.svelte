		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>
			"We", "our" and "us" refers to whatever.social's maintainers and/or
			developers. "You" refers to you as the user of our services.

			Whatever Social is committed to giving users more control over their digital life. This is why we
			take steps to help ensure we are providing a private and secure experience while you browse your

		<h2>üë§ Personal Data</h2>
		<p>
			While visiting our sites: The logging done on our sites is minimal to keep the experience
			private. The primary surface of our logging is in NGINX (A service that we use on our server), where logs kept disabled.
			However, this may not always be the case. In the event of a critical system error or an attack
			on our services, such as a DDoS, it may be necessary to temporarily enable logs to diagnose and
			remedy the issue. In scenarios such as these, logs will be purged as soon as the issue is dealt
			with. If you are found to be engaging in activities that harm our services, such as spamming,
			DDoS or brute-force attacks, your IP address may be stored permanently to protect us, our
			services and other users of our services. View the "Law Enforcement" section of this policy to
			see how we may be forced to enable them in other situations. An NGINX log, in the duration that
			its stored, may include your IP address, user agent, and a timestamp along with your web
			request. See the "Third-parties providing Technical Services" section of this policy.
			<br />
			<br />
			Information you provide to us: Usernames are stored for the services they apply to. Your e-mail address
			is received by us when you choose to contact us via e-mail. Your Session Messenger "ID" is received
			by us when you choose to contact us via Session. No other identifiable information is provided by
			you to us.
			<br />
			<br />
			Information we share: Your information is not shared with other entities, except in the cases outlined
			in the "Third-parties providing Technical Services", "Third-parties providing Payment Services",
